* When using the repl(read-eval-print-loop), it is very convenient to ad a sequence of bindings from a file. 
* `use` command is used for loading sequence of bindings from a file into repl.
* `use` commands has the type `unit` and evaluates to `()`, but its effect is to include all the bindings from the loaded file.
