# How ML Does Not Provide Access to Datatype Values

* How can we access the values inside of the datatype bindings.
* Lists, and options have built-in functions for accessing those wrapped values.
* How about user-defned datatype bindings ?
    * In ML we can write those built-in functions that accesses the wrapped values using pattern matching.
